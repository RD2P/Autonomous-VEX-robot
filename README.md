# Autonomous VEX robot
 Autonomous robot built with VEX kit components searches an area of 2.3 square meters for an IR source. Once the IR target is identified, the robot approaches and places an object on top of the target using a mechanical arm.
 Components: 
  VEX controller
  *2 x motors drive 4 wheels for locomotion
  *1 x motor drives arm for object placement
  *1 x phototransistor detects IR source
  *3 x ultrasonic sensors detects walls and gauges distance to target
